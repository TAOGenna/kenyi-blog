# Overview

Since I got interested in ML, and technology in general, I've gathered some kind of mental list of people's blogs I should check from time to time. I call these _high signal people_. But not only they share technical knowledge from ML or SWE, the blogs I enjoy the most are the ones that dig deep into whatever thing you consider normal.

## What this post is about 

Here I will just be listing all the _high signal people/blogs_ I found so far. This post in particular will serve as a repo so I don't keep things locally. 

Also, I might not limit my list only to tech stuff. 

## High Signal P 

[George Hotz](https://www.youtube.com/@geohotarchive): Guy who hacked the Iphone and PS4. He maintains a series of video blogs where he implements things from scratch.

[Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com): Blog on ML system design from her books and writings. She also had a course on Stanford on that very same topic. 

[Julian Schrittwieser](https://www.furidamu.org): Proficient SWE engineer, one of the main authors of the AlphaGo paper from Deepmind, but most of blogs are just random cool tech stuff. 

[Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io): Another gem. She's pretty good at distilling very complex ML topics into digestible blogs.

[Simon Boehm](https://siboehm.com): Performance engineer. His blogs focus more on the low-level engineering part of the things. 

[Alfredo de la Fuente](https://github.com/Alfo5123): Even though he doesn't blog anymore, I enjoyed his blogs. They were mainly about random applications of probability theory.

[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/blog/): Doesn't need introduction actually.

## RecSys (From my time at Yape)

[Vinija Notes](https://vinija.ai/recsys/): Notes on recommendation systems.

[ApplyingML](https://applyingml.com/): Guides on recsys and interviews. 

[Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/): Blogs by principal applied scientist at Amazon.

Bojan Tunguz: xNvidia, grandmaster in Kaggle, xgboost guru(?)
- https://github.com/tunguz/ML_Resources
- https://www.xgblog.ai/p/xgboost-is-all-you-need (A series of 7 blogs on Xgboost)
- Other Kaggle GMs that prob have posts: [David Austin](https://www.kaggle.com/tivfrvqhs5), [Ruchi Bathia](https://www.kaggle.com/tivfrvqhs5) and [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte).

## BioML

[Gabriele Corso](https://github.com/gcorso): One of the creators of Boltz, a library competing with Alphafold. 

[Chaitanya Joshi](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/): PhD student at Cambridge with a focus on deep learning for molecular modelling.
- [Getting started with 3D RNA modelling as a machine learner](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/rna-modelling-and-design/)
- [Transformers are GNNs](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/transformers-are-gnns/)

[Kieran Didi](https://kdidi.netlify.app/index/): PhD student at Oxford, focus on computational biology.
