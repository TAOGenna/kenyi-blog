# Overview

Since I got interested in ML, and technology in general, I've gathered some kind of mental list of people's blogs I should check from time to time. I call these _high signal people_. But not only they share technical knowledge from ML or SWE, the blogs I enjoy the most are the ones that dig deep into whatever thing you consider normal. Take for example the article from Julian Schrittwieser on _HDR photography_. Is it related to his past work on Google Deepmind? No, he's just playing and enjoying the tech we have right now. For someone like me who has just started his journey into tech these blogs are fascinating and I thank them very much for being this open and sharing cool stuff.

## What this post is about 

Here I will just be listing all the _high signal people/blogs_ I found so far. This post in particular will serve as a repo so I don't keep things locally. 

Also, I might not limit my list only to tech-ish people. 

## High Signal P 

[George Hotz](https://www.youtube.com/@geohotarchive): Guy who hacked the Iphone and PS3. He has two companies, one about self driving cars and another one on ML framework called Tinygrad. His channel on Youtube is a hidden gem that I think everyone should follow.

[Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com): I am learning ML system design from her books and writings. She also had a course on Stanford on that very same topic. 

[Julian Schrittwieser](https://www.furidamu.org): Proficient SWE engineer, one of the main authors of the AlphaGo paper from Deepmind. 

[Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io): Another gem. Just check out her blog pls pls. 

[Kieran Didi](https://kdidi.netlify.app/index/): PhD student at Oxford, focus on computational biology.

[Simon Boehm](https://siboehm.com): Performance engineer. His blogs focus more on the low-level engineering part of the things. 

[Alfredo de la Fuente](https://github.com/Alfo5123): Even though he doesn't blog anymore, I enjoyed his blogs. 

### BioML

[Gabriele Corso](https://github.com/gcorso): One of the creators of Boltz, a library competing with Alphafold. 

[Chaitanya Joshi](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/): PhD student at Cambridge with a focus on deep learning for molecular modelling.
- [Getting started with 3D RNA modelling as a machine learner](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/rna-modelling-and-design/)
- [Transformers are GNNs](https://www.chaitjo.com/post/transformers-are-gnns/)
