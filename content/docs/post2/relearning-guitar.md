I am not coming from a long brake from music, but I've been playing the same two songs for years in guitar.

- _River flows in you_ by Sungha Jung (arrange from Yiruma)
- _How's moving castle_ by Sungha Jung (easy version)

I mean, I love these songs but I always wanted sort of understand music in a deeper level. May be it is because of my roots in physics that I want to understand everything from first principles.

Also, there is the question between composing and interpretation. But why not both? I think I can recall a few times when I came up with some arpegio or chord progression that wasn't trivial, those, I guess, were my firt compositions. But I know there is more magic to it than just that. See this genius [pinkguy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p37_Ux1G_BI) for peak composition skills. Ok, jokes aside, I guess I would like to go through something like [alfo5123](https://alfo5123.github.io/ideas/music) did, some sort of learning to compose journey. To accomplish this I should learn to record me correctly, no more phone recordings.

In the future, I would like to be good at guitar, piano and cello. Is not common in Peru to have a cello but I've always found the cello sound to be darker and sexier than other string instruments.

Here is my interpretation of the solo guitar of _Hotel California_, I would say that was my peak lol.

But anyway, time to move on. For some time now I've been fascinated by how one can reach new sounds once you include tapping into the songs. Next up I will try to interpret:
- [Ben Lapps arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Xo8iYn16Q) of _Going to California_ by Led Zeppelin
- Some techniques by Ichika Nito, the god of tapping
- Bari Improv - August Ruch OST
